# Specification

![Image](../../Images/Design4.jpg)

The specification tool lets you define :

- the current "specification"
- the current section

By default there is no predefined specification. Everything you create will be "Out of spec".

You can define one or more **specification** by clicking the **Data** button.

The goal of a specification is to supervise the engineer's work by predefining all piping elements, sections, materials, bend radius, reducer lengths, tees...

Click [here](https://documentation.metapiping.com/Settings/Specifications.html) for more information about creation of specification.

The possible sections must be defined in the **Data** window. You can there create all materials and all piping sections or, selecting predefined **specifications**.
