### 1.1 File

During the design of the model, every command is automatically saved in a temporary file (conception.~metaL).

You can decide to save the last modifications or cancel it and return to the study screen.

A floppy disk on the left side of the ribbon indicates the sate of the file on disk :

![Image](../Images/Design5.jpg) means that everything has been saved.

![Image](../Images/Design6.jpg) means that something has changed and the MetaL need to be saved.
