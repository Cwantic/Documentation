# Study

A study consists of a **Diagram** of bricks and connections.

It is a folder that contains at least a 3D model and the calculation results.

![Image](../Images/Study1.jpg)

The **study** screen consists of :

1. The **Bricks**
2. The main panel that shows the **Study Diagram**
3. The **Solver brick**
4. A **Connector**
5. A **Connector**
6. The **Edit** button to open the 3D model

An empty study contains at least one **Study brick** and one **Solver brick**.
## 1. Connections

Connect the connectors 4 and 5 to define the current **Solver**. 

    Press left mouse button above connector 4 -> move the mouse to connector 5 -> release the left button

    To remove the connection : select the connection and press DELETE on the keyboard.

Select **Aster** for example :

### 3.1 File

This create a brick that lets you import a file of any extension.

![Image](../Images/Study3.jpg)

This is useful only for Python scripts that need a file as input (Ex : Excel file or Text file).

Click on the button to open a search file dialog.

Use the connector to send the file to another brick as an input.

{: .warning }
>You can import another **MetaL** file and connect it to the **MetaL** connector of the **Study brick**.

### 3.2 Study link

This create a brick that virtually replicates existing studies inside another one. This is useful to create new nodes based on those of the linked studies.

![Image](../Images/Study10.jpg)

{: .warning }
>You can connect multiple studies. All must be defined in the same coordinate system XYZ.

{: .warning }
>In design, you can hide the linked studies.

{: .warning }
>In design, you cannot modify elements of linked studies.

### 3.3 PCF

The **plugin** PCF lets you import *.pcf files.

![Image](../Images/Study4.jpg)

Open a file and connect it to the **MetaL** connector of the **Study brick**.

This will convert the PCF to the MetaL file format.

### 3.4 PIPSYS

The **plugin** PIPSYS lets you import files with several extensions.

![Image](../Images/Study5.jpg)

Open a file and connect it to the **MetaL** connector of the **Study brick**.

This will convert the PIPSYS to the MetaL file format.

### 3.5 PIPESTRESS

The **plugin** PIPESTRESS lets you import *.fre (and *.thf files).

The Time History File is not mandatory and depends on the corresponding FRE file.

![Image](../Images/Study6.jpg)

Open a file and connect it to the **MetaL** connector of the **Study brick**.

This will convert the FRE to the MetaL file format.

The **plugin** PIPESTRESS also lets you import POSTR files for postprocessing.

![Image](../Images/Study7.jpg)

Open a file and connect it to the **Solution** connector of the **Solver brick**.

It will produce a text file (in the result cell) that can be edited by **double click**.

You can specify your favorite text editor in the settings.

The **plugin** PIPESTRESS also lets you configure all bricks by just importing a *.fre file. It checks if a *.thf file is needed, sets the Solver to PIPESTRESS and makes all connections automatically.

### 3.6 Python

You can create your own **brick** thanks to the Python scripts.

### 3.7 Comment

This creates a brick with text and color capabilities.

### 3.8 Post-processing : supports + flanges

This brick lets you create combinations (or groups) of load cases defined in the piping model and output various results for those combinations :
- reactions on restraints
- displacements at nodes
- internal forces and moments in elements

It also allows to check flanges according to various piping codes.

![Image](../Images/PostProc1.jpg)

Click on **Definition** to open the definition window. 

Once the data are entered, click on **Run** to launch the analysis. A report with the detailed results will show up after the analysis is completed.

The definition window consists of several tabs.

#### 3.8.1 General

![Image](../Images/PostProc2.jpg)

Enter the root of the file name where the input data will be saved. The file will be given the extension **.post**. The results will be saved in a file with the same root and extension **.rpost**.

You may also enter a title and a memo.

Check the box **Process all restraints** to output the reactions for all supports. If checked, the reactions can be output in the local coordinates of the supports (instead of the global coordinates) by checking the box **Output the reactions in local coordinate system**.

If flanges are to be checked, select the piping code, edition, and calculation method.


#### 3.8.2 Groups

![Image](../Images/PostProc3.jpg)

A group is a combination of load cases defined in the piping model, and/or previously created groups.

| Field | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| No. | Group number |
| Method | Algebraic, Envelope, SRSS, or Absolute |
| No out. | No result is output if checked |
| Add lines | The results for the group are output in a single line (except for flange check). In order to improve readability, additional lines may be inserted after the group. For example, enter the string **#-#** to insert a line filled with **#** characters, followed by another line filled with **-** characters, and finally a line filled with **#** characters. Use character **b** for inserting a blank line |
| Level | A (or blank), B, C, D or T (for flange check only) |
