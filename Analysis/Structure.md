### 2.5 Stresses

1. Select the **Stress** button
2. Select the result type
3. Click on a column of the **Data panel** to sort the desired data
4. Select a row
5. The corresponding element is highlighted

![Image](../Images/Analysis22.jpg)

The results are **code dependent**. The third column shows the stress ratio, defined as the calculated stress divided by the allowable stress.

The stresses are shown at each extremity of the elements. The maximum stresses of both extremities may be displayed instead by checking "Show max element stress" :
