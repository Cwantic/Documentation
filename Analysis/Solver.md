# Solvers

MetaPiping has a built-in solver : Code_Aster from EDF.

## 1. Code_Aster

    Code_Aster offers a full range of multiphysical analysis and modelling methods that go well beyond the
    standard functions of a thermomechanical calculation code: from seismic analysis to porous media via
    acoustics, fatigue, stochastic dynamics, etc.

Supported codes :

- EN 13480-3 Edition 2020 with Table H.3 (bidirectionnal SIFs)
- RCC-M Class 1 & 2 Editions 2002, 2007, 2012, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020
