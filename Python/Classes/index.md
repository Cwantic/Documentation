# Classes

MetaPiping opens its classes in order to allow the user to **navigate** inside the structure of objects and create custom information processing.

The **study** object is the start point for "project script" to access the other objects.

The **design** object is the start point for "design script".

The internal format of the whole model in Design mode is the **metaL** object (aka **metaL**anguage).

After calculation, the **solution** object contains all the results.

The instructions that MetaPiping understand during model construction are the **command** objects.
