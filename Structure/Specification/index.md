# Specification

![Image](../../Images/Structure3.jpg)

The specification tool lets you define the current beam section and material.

You can define one or more **specification** by clicking the **Data** button.

The goal of a specification is to predefine the possible sections for the model with associated materials, descriptions and colors.

You have also an access to the model options (code, edition, calculation options...) by clicking the **Model options** button.
