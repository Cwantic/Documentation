### 1.1 File

During the **load case** definition, every command is automatically saved in a temporary file (conception.~metaL).

You can decide to save the last modifications or cancel it and return to the study screen.

A floppy disk on the left side of the ribbon indicates the state of the file on disk :

![Image](../Images/Design5.jpg) means that everything has been saved.

![Image](../Images/Design6.jpg) means that something has changed and the MetaL need to be saved.

{: .warning }
>If the application crashes, MetaPiping will prompt to reopen the last modifications.

### 1.2 Undo/Redo

Every command in MetaPiping is stored in a **command list**.

You can *navigate* through this list by pressing the **Undo/Redo** buttons.

## 2. Data controller

All loads can be viewed, created, edited, moved and removed in a single treeview :
