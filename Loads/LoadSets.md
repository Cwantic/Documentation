# Load sets (Class 1 only)

    This load is a specific combination of loads assumed to act simultaneously on a piping system
    at a given instant. Pairs of load sets are employed in pipe stress analysis to determine 
    physical changes in the system from one load set instant to another.
    Typical load set parameters, which may occur in various combinations, are : pressure,
    temperature, moment and transient effects.

When selecting **Load sets** load type, all existing load sets are listed in the combobox :

The loads appear with the **Title**. There is no **Case number** for that kind of loading.
