# Sustained - Test

Suggested equation :

    6. Test

## 1. Options

![Image](../../Images/Static12.jpg)

In options, you can :

1. Take the operating conditions from another static case
2. Include **Bourdon effect**
3. Use **cold modulus**

This case automatically includes the test weight.

## 2. Applied loads

The applied loads are the same as explained on **Sustained - Operating** page.
