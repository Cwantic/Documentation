# Occasional - Distributed

Suggested equation :

    3. Equation 9 B (occasional)

## 1. Options

In options, you can :

1. Take the operating conditions from another static case
2. Use **cold modulus**

## 2. Applied loads

It is possible to define specific loads :

### 2.1 Distributed loads

![Image](../../Images/Static32.jpg)

You can define distributed loads on elements of the model.

You can also define **DEFAULT** distributed loads that will be applied on all elements of the model :

| Property | Unit Metric | Unit USA |
| -------- | ---- | ---- |
| FX | N/m | lb/ft |
| FY | N/m | lb/ft |
| FZ | N/m | lb/ft |

If you check this option, you will see this **button** :

![Image](../../Images/Static7.jpg)

1. Select the **Distributed** button
2. Open the right **Data panel**
3. Select one or more elements
4. Define the new **vector force** for these elements
5. Apply

You can **undo** this command.

Click on the **Remove** button to delete the load on selected elements.

You can **undo** this command.

You can also change the size of the drawed forces by clicking on these buttons :
