# Occasional - Acceleration

Suggested equation :

    3. Equation 9 B (occasional)

## 1. Options

![Image](../../Images/Static34.jpg)

In options, you can :

1. Take the operating conditions from another static case
2. Use **cold modulus**

This case automatically includes the "Pseudo-static case" option.

## 2. Applied loads

It is possible to define specific loads :

### 2.1 Static accelerations

![Image](../../Images/Static36.jpg)

You can define acceleration loads on elements of the model.

You can also define **DEFAULT** acceleration loads that will be applied on all elements of the model :

| Property | Unit Metric | Unit USA |
| -------- | ---- | ---- |
| GX | fraction of G | fraction of G |
| GY | fraction of G | fraction of G |
| GZ | fraction of G | fraction of G |

If you check this option, you will see this **button** :

1. Select the **Acceleration** button
2. Open the right **Data panel**
3. Select one or more elements
4. Define the new **vector acceleration** for these elements
5. Apply
