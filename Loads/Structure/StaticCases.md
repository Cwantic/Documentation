# Static cases

    Static cases consist of internal and/or external static loadings on the piping system. MetaPiping 
    will calculate corresponding displacements, rotations, forces, moments and stresses.

All existing static cases are listed in the combobox with their **Case number** + **Title** :

When editing or creating a static case, the definition window shows up. There are three tabs : General, Options and Applied loads.

## 1. General

    Documentation will come soon...
