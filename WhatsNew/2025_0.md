# MetaPiping/MetaStructure 2025

## *Launch date*

* June 2025

## *Main features*

>New code/features in ASTER solver :

* RCC-MRx Edition 2022 (high temperature, research and fusion reactor)
* Validation tool for MetaPiping : 130 test cases
* Validation tool for MetaStructure : 108 test cases

>Finite Element Analysis :

* Available for pipe, bend and concentric reducer

>Load :

* Treeview of loads that enable user to create, edit, insert, move and remove loads in one synoptic view

>Analysis :

* Result files tab

>Materials :

* RCC-MRx materials
* Fatigue curve for Class 1 materials

>Structure :

* Option 'cable' for bracing modelling in beam definition

## *Secondary features*

>Supervisor :

* Batch mode to launch analysis of multiple studies in one operation

>Python :

* Study script can access the solver, the commands and the Finite Element Analyser

>Design :

* Right tab in docked view or in a window
* New property "End conditions" that enable user to change the joint of multiple selected nodes

>Structure :

* New property "Sections" that enable user to change the section of multiple selected beams

>Review :

* Measure tool shows nodes coordinates and work with one selected point. The distance is calculated between current and previous point
* Lump mass tab shows also the mass of elements like valves and flanges 
* Specification tab shows also the tees

>Reporting :

* New keyword "FILE" to add files in report (*.fre, *.sifs, *.modal, *.fatigue...)
* New parameter NMax to limit the results in report to the NMax greatest values
* New Word template for piping in Finite Element Analysis

>Miscellaneous :

* Help application (instead of web pages)
* Shortcut for selection F10 (node), F11 (element/beam) and F12 (restraint)
* New view button : labels, restraints and lump masses
* Change length to 0 remove an element
