# MetaPiping 2024

## *Launch date*

* March 2024

## *Main features*

>New application MetaStructure :

    - Advanced structural/pipe supports/assemblies/anchor plates calculation - fully integrated to MetaPiping
    - Beam section database
    - Fastener and bolt database
    - New study type (structure)
    - Linked studies between piping and supports
    - Beam analysis according to ASME III NF, RCC-M, EN 13480-3 and EN 1993-1-1
    - Bolted joint analysis according to ASME III NF, RCC-M, EN 13480-3 and EN 1993-1-1
    - Weld analysis according to ASME III NF, RCC-M, EN 13480-3 or EN 1993-1-1.
      + The geometry of the weld beads is automatically determined according to the cross-section and angle between the assembled sections.
      + Multiple weld bead configurations.
      + Verification of weld stresses.
      + The forces transmitted in the welds are recalculated if the connection is not right-angled.
      + Verification of the LAMELLAR TEARING in the base metal.
    - Anchor plate analysis according to EN 1992-4 Edition 2018
      + Lescouarc'h method for calculating forces in fasteners (rigid plate)
      + All regular configurations supported + possibility of modifying fastener positions to avoid concrete reinforcing bars
      + No limit to the number of fasteners
      + Concept of drilling tolerance
      + Notion of virtual concrete edge to avoid interference between fastener influence zones
      + Complete definition of concrete
      + Free orientation of the anchor plate
      + Consideration of profile eccentricity on the plate
      + Consideration of assembly with spacing and grouting
      + Consideration of configurations with spade to take up shear forces
      + Realistic visualization of anchoring
    - Parametric structure by python script
    - Import database from BeamStress (materials, sections, fasteners)
    - Import *.bst files

>Non-linear static analysis :

    - Soil definition (buried piping properties)
    - Non-linear restraint

## *Secondary features*

>Explorer :

    - Import/export of project

>Design :

    - Properties on elements : mounting temperature, design conditions, calculation code
    - Move nodes tool
    - Change length of element tool
    - Cut bend in N elements

>Review :

    - Improvement of measuring tool

>Database :

    - Drag&Drop capabilities in hierarchy trees
