# MetaPiping/MetaStructure 2024.1

## *Launch date*

* October 2024

## *Main features*

>New codes/features in ASTER solver :

    - ASME III Appendix XXVI (High Density Polyethylene Piping)
    - EDF Composite Piping (E.N.S.IN/91-025 indice D and E)
    - Mixed-class and mixed-material piping

>Databases :

    - Rating database for post-processing purpose

>Piping study :

    - New post-processing brick for flange check according to ASME III Appendix XI,
      RCC-M Appendix Z and EN 13480-3 Appendix D
    - New post-processing brick for support load combinations

>Load :

    - Time-history file generator
    - Evaluation of cut-off frequency for time-history files

>Reporting

    - Template and table (*.docx) definition in the settings
    - Report generator with programmable pictures

>Finite element analysis

    - Detailed analysis of flexible anchor plates (MetaStructure) by means of plate and shell finite 
      elements for various stiffener arrangements, taking into account non-linear plate/concrete 
      contact and material plasticity.
    - Report generation

## *Secondary features*

>Explorer

    - Rename folder and project

>Study

    - Import *.MetaL file (via file brick)

>Design :

    - Absolute coordinate of point
    - Show/hide origin symbol and concrete
    - Merge of bends
    - Bend creation between 2 nodes
    - New property "Section" that enable user to change the section of multiple piping elements
    - Label on restraints and elements
    - Selection based on node name or element label

>Miscellaneous :

    - Insert capabilities in some database's tables
    - Graduated 3D wheel with 1Â° of precision
    - New anchor representation if at least one spring constant released (disk instead of box)
