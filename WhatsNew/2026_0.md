# MetaPiping/MetaStructure 2026

## *Launch date*

* February 2026

## *Main features*

>Code updates in ASTER solver :

* RCC-M 2022
* ASME III  2023 and 2025
* B31.1 2022 and 2024
* EN 13480-3 2024
* Guide EDF D305921021240 indice B (HDPE)

>Pipe-support coupling

* New brick "Distant structures" in piping study for structure studies selection
* Fusion of the piping and structures models for a "one pass" analysis
* Injection of the results in the structure's studies

>Python improvement

* Faster execution for non virtual environment scripts
* Hierarchy tree for better organization of the scripts
* New right tab for python script in piping, structure, review, load and analysis screens
* Possibility to disable chatGPT

>Structure

* U-bolt capabilities at junction between pipe and structures
* Free stiffener definition

## *Secondary features*

>Settings

* Color definition of piping elements
* Transparency mode for linked models and distant structures

>Database :

* U-bolts database
* Paste Excel content in spectrum database via clipboard

>Design

* Matrix element
* Measure tool accessible in piping and structure screens
* Copy tool (translation, rotation and mirror)
* Tool to calculate the mass of the section

>Materials

* EDF3 specification for HDPE materials
* New node joint : HDPE bolted flange
* New tee type : Sidewall fusion branch connection

>Load

* Paste Excel content in spectrum table and in Time History table via clipboard

>Analysis

* N, T, M diagrams
* Overstress checkbox with 2 colors legend

>Miscellaneous :

* Insert rigid capability
* New view buttons : increase and decrease support size, inner pipe visibility, font modification
